**WARN: (EMS-63):	Message <ENCDB-2504> has exceeded the default message display limit of 20.
To avoid this warning, increase the display limit per unique message by
using the set_message -limit <number> command.
The message limit can be removed by using the set_message -no_limit command.
Note that setting a very large number using the set_message -limit command
or removing the message limit using the set_message -no_limit command can
significantly increase the log file size.
To suppress a message, use the set_message -suppress command.

**WARN: (ENCSYT-7328):	The design has been initialized in physical-only mode because the init_mmmc_file global variable was not defined. Timing analysis will not be possible within this session. You can only use commands that do not depend on timing data. If you need to use timing, you need to restart with an init_mmmc_file to define the timing setup, or you can save this design and use restore_design -mmmc_file <viewDef.tcl> to add the timing setup information.
